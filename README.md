# Lucid

Lucid is a web framework focused on simplicity â€” with minimal boilerplate, getting started takes only about 100 lines of code.

## Getting started

To get started with Lucid, look in the `example` directory; it is only a total of 131 lines of code, meaning you can easily read through all of it in just a few minutes!

### Dependancies

Lucid runs with no dependencies.
The example only has one dependency other than Lucid itself: [Maggy](https://github.com/JoelNiemela/Maggy).

### Installing

To install Lucid, run `sudo make install`. This will install the Lucid library to `/usr/local/lib/Lucid/` and the `lucid` cli to `/usr/local/bin/lucid`. If you wish to install Lucid elsewhere, take care to modify *both* `install.sh` *and* `cli/lucid.sh`.

### Creating a new project

To create a new project, simply run `lucid init <name>`. This will create a new directory `<name>` which includes the basic file structure of a Lucid project.

## About Lucid

Lucid is currently in early development; the latest version is 0.1.0-alpha.
